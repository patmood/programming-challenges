# Fibonacci!

Someone asked me to describe how to code a fibonacci sequence over the phone, so this is just some demo/practice code to refresh my memory.

Sequence of fibonacci numbers is defined by:

Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2

with seed values

F0 = 0, F1 = 1

The sequence starts as:

0,1,1,2,3,4,5,13,21,34,55

This program calculates the nth numbver in the fibonacci sequence.
